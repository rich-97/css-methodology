# css-methodology

My own methodology of css using:

- **itcss**.
- **BEM**.
- **OOCSS**.

This methodology use as preprocesor [scss](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SCSS_FOR_SASS_USERS.html).

## Installation

1.  Clone the repo in your project.
3.  Install the dependencies with `bower install`.
2.  Rename the repo to `scss` or what ever you want.
